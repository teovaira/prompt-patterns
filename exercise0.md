# Exercise 0: Environment and Libraries

## Objective
Set up the environment for Python development.

## Steps Completed

### 1. Install Python
Python is already installed on the system.

### 2. Verify Installation
```bash
$ python3 --version
Python 3.12.3
```

### 3. Hello World Program
Created `hello_world.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print("Hello, World!")
```

### 4. Execute Hello World
```bash
$ python3 hello_world.py
Hello, World!
```

## Virtual Environment Setup
The specs mention "Virtual Environment" as OpenAI Playground or ChatGPT interface for the exercises, so no local virtual environment is needed for this project.

## Result
Environment is ready for prompt pattern exercises with Python 3.12.3 installed and working.
