# Exercise 3: Prompt Transformation with Patterns

## Objective
Strengthen weak prompts using patterns.

## Original Weak Prompt
"Write about climate change."

## Transformed Prompts

### Instructional Pattern
"Write a 200-word explanation of climate change for high school learners."

**Output**: Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While climate variations are natural, human activities since the 1800s have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. These activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which trap heat from the sun and warm the planet. The main greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, produced when we burn fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation. As temperatures rise, we see melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather events like hurricanes and droughts. These changes affect ecosystems, agriculture, and human communities worldwide. Scientists measure climate change through temperature records, ice core samples, and satellite data. The effects are already visible: Arctic ice is shrinking, coral reefs are bleaching, and weather patterns are becoming more unpredictable. To address climate change, we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, improving energy efficiency, and changing transportation methods. Individual actions like using less energy and supporting sustainable practices also help combat this global challenge.

### Comparative Pattern
"Compare the effects of climate change on coastal vs inland regions in 5 bullet points."

**Output**:
• Sea level rise directly threatens coastal areas with flooding and erosion, while inland regions face drought and water scarcity issues
• Coastal regions experience stronger hurricanes and storm surges, whereas inland areas deal with more frequent wildfires and heat waves
• Coastal ecosystems like coral reefs and wetlands are damaged by ocean acidification, while inland forests suffer from pest outbreaks and tree mortality
• Coastal agriculture faces saltwater intrusion into farmland, while inland farming struggles with changing precipitation patterns and soil degradation
• Coastal cities require expensive sea walls and flood defenses, while inland communities need improved water management and cooling systems

## Analysis
The instructional pattern improved the weak prompt by specifying audience (high school learners), word count (200 words), and format (explanation). This created focused, educational content instead of vague general writing.

The comparative pattern added structure by requiring specific comparison (coastal vs inland) and format (5 bullet points). This produced organized, analytical content that directly contrasts different impacts rather than general discussion.

Both transformations eliminated ambiguity and provided clear direction, resulting in more useful and targeted outputs.
